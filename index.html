    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Noah McDonald, I am a high school student with a passion for mathematics and computer science. 
        I have always enjoyed the abstract logic of maths and such I now like to explore topics such as number theory and real analysis.
        Sometimes I can't visualize these concepts in my head so I write programs to help me understand how thing work.
        In computer science I enjoy algorithms and data structures.
    <p>
       Oh and my favorite theorem is Fermat's Little Theorem
       $$ a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ p) $$
       for any integer \( a \) not divisible by the prime \( p \).:

    <h2>Fractals</h2>
    <p>Fractals have always fascinated, you can explore them for hours and not even uncover a fraction of their patterns.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="src/mandelbrot.png" alt="Mandelbrot Set" style="float:left; width:450px; margin-right:15px;">
        Here is a render of the Mandelbrot set drawn with a project I wrote. It generated based on the equation:
        $$ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c $$
        I find it crazy that such a simple formula can produce such patterns. 
        Did you know, unlike most shapes, fractals don't exist only in 2 or 3 dimensions but exist in any number of dimensions? 
        For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake</a> has a Hausdorff dimension of 
        \( \log_3(4) \approx 1.26 \)
