## Hi there 👋

Hello! My name is Noah McDonald, I am a high school student with a passion for mathematics and computer science. 
I have always enjoyed the abstract logic of maths and such I now like to explore topics such as number theory and real analysis.
Sometimes I can't visualize these concepts in my head so I write programs to help me understand how thing work.
In computer science I enjoy algorithms and data structures.
